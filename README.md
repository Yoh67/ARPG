# Software
* Git LFS
* Visual Studio 2022

# Requirements
* Unreal Engine v5.2.1 (Current version as of 09/21/23)
* MovementAnimsetPro
	* Store asset pack that is kept up to date with each version of the engine, can be provided via .zip
	* Asset packs are large so versioning them is a challenge, this is why it is in the gitignore, if I'm missing anything I can provide it
	* Download here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CMxd16UvAX7pP5UxDVoGdlucfj0Evg-v/view?usp=drive_link
